The score for the hand is the sum of the score for each word formed.
The score for a word is the product of two components:
First component: the sum of the points for letters in the word.
Second component: either [7 * word_length - 3 * (n - word_length)] or 1,whichever value is greater,
where: ->word_length is the number of letters used in the word ->n is the number of letters available in the current hand
